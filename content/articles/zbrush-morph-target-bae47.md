This article will cover an example of ZBrush in combination with DAZ 3d, however it can be used in any other combination (like Maya, 3DS Max, Blender, Mudbox and more). 

<div class="w-note"><p>If you work with Genesis 8 then I highly recommend to download the <strong>freely available</strong> <a href="https://www.daz3d.com/forums/discussion/342081/itf-character-dev-kit-for-g8f" target="_blank">ITF Dev Kit for Genesis 8 Female by InTheFlesh</a> - it has some great shortcuts to export characters, prepare body parts for sculpting and textures and to setup DFormer Maps quickly.</p></div>

**ZBrush's Morph Target** is a great tool for a lot of different situations, including but limited to:
- Preparing **Layers** (e.g. you have multiple displacement maps with features that you want to combine seamlessly)
- Restoring partial or total meshes
- Combining meshes
- Delicately enhancing a high sub-divided mesh 
- Setting up seamless subdivisions on a mesh **without losing volume**

<div class="w-warn"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Morph Targeting only works with different meshes if they have the <strong>same polygon amount</strong> and vertex order.</p></div>

#### 1. Restoring Parts Of A Mesh
Let's say you notice inside DAZ or ZBrush that the teeth of your character are botched and you have no access to a backup or the one you have is way too old. **Options:**
- Use the Generic Genesis 8 Female as a template
- Use a character you made prior as a template
- Use an older version as a template

#### 1.1 Exporting the Mesh from DAZ 3d to ZBrush
When you've chosen your preferred character it's time to export it from DAZ. Make sure that anything but the character itself is not visible or removed from the viewport, then export it to any location you like.
